# React Native Path to Mastery

What's here is not an exact criterion of different levels of a software developer and ultimately depends on your team and levels of accountability. A senior in one team may be a mid-level in another.

Regardless, as you improve in technical skills, depending on the team and skill requirements, it's often the soft skills such as team building, management and convincing ability that makes teams happier to give you more responsibility.

The following are curated resources to take on knowledge, but the idea is to master each segment. You should be able to teach each topic to someone else as an idea to know if you know the subject or not.

*NOTE: as an alternative, consider investigating yourself. However, this is curated off many resources and community standards. Have a start with [roadmap.sh - frontend](https://roadmap.sh/frontend).*

*ALSO NOTE: This document will change as time passes and includes many opinions of libraries/software (unless stated otherwise). Many TODOs exist in this document that needs future investigation.*

### Tighter Native Knowledge

This doesn’t need to much detail but it’s largely going deeper into native development since the more complex things that can be done in Native can be integrated into a RN app. Go deeper in iOS and Android development.Also worth considering other platforms and building on them eg, windows, MacOS, Watches, virtual reality devices, alternative platforms such as rendering React into Gaming engines etc.

This will also include NDK and using C/C++ or Rust code in these platforms.

### DevOps/Infrustructure

This is where we get into the stage of developer tools. A lot of this will delve into backend however knowledge of these are useful if your looking to extend tools such as fast lane or automative Native platforms or CI/CD platforms.

A common language used for Automation tools, eg python [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com) or Go [go.dev tour](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1) (Fastlane uses ruby)

However the rest of the path gets into backend related situations. The roadmap.sh for DevOps looks like a good idea, tailor to your needs [roadmap.sh - devops](https://roadmap.sh/devops)

### General Computer Science Topics

This section is a general one as it covers all above without the focus being the deployment of a product. Many of these things will translate to better quality development or advanced techniques in other areas. Eg compilers for static analysis tools or functional/type theory for better code architecture and patterns.

A good reference for things to look into [What every computer science major should know - Matt Might](https://matt.might.net/articles/what-cs-majors-should-know/) or [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com). A good recommendation of things to dive deeper into are functional programming, operating systems and networkings, compilers, algorithms/data-structures, cryptography/security, concurrency/distributed systems. 
Also worth having a bit of practice on forgotten algorithms on [leetCode](https://leetcode.com), some of them defined here [Algorithms for Competitive Programming](https://cp-algorithms.com/index.html)
